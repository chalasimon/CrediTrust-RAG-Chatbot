## Task 1 Summary

### Data Characteristics
- **Original Dataset**: 9,609,797 complaints (21 products)  
- **Filtered Dataset**: 478,818 complaints (5 target products)  
- **Products Retained (Mapped)**:
  - Saving account: 155,204 (~32.4%)  
  - Buy now, pay later: 118,128 (~24.7%)  
  - Money transfers: 98,685 (~20.6%)  
  - Credit card: 80,667 (~16.9%)  
  - Personal loan: 26,134 (~5.5%)  

➡️ Filtering and mapping ensured that all 5 project-required categories are captured, including products that were previously under alternate labels.  

---

### Narrative Analysis (after mapping & cleaning)
- **Total Narratives**: 478,818  
- **Word Count Distribution**:
  - Mean: ~203 words  
  - Std. Dev.: ~221  
  - Min: 1 word  
  - 25th percentile: 82 words  
  - Median: 136 words  
  - 75th percentile: 252 words  
  - Max: 6,469 words  

- **Short Narratives (<5 words)**: 275  
- **Long Narratives (>1000 words)**: 5,110  
- **Missing Narratives**: 0 (all retained rows contain valid text)  

➡️ Compared to the original dataset (~69% missing narratives), the filtered dataset now contains entirely meaningful complaint narratives.  

---

### Cleaning & Mapping Pipeline
- **Product Mapping**: original CFPB product names → 5 target categories (*Credit card, Personal loan, Buy now, pay later, Saving account, Money transfers*)  
- **Text Normalization**:
  - Lowercasing  
  - Removal of redacted placeholders (`XX`)  
  - Removal of special characters  
  - Whitespace normalization  

---

### Output
- **Filtered dataset saved at**: `../data/processed/filtered_complaints.csv`  
- Contains cleaned complaint narratives mapped to the **5 target product categories**.  

---

### Next Steps
- **Proceed to embedding generation** for the RAG pipeline using `clean_text` column.  
- Optional: Visualize complaint distribution and narrative lengths for reporting.  
- Dataset is now ready for downstream modeling and retrieval tasks.
